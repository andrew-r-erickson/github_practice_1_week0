# Abstract

Here, I re-examine the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).

# Life Expectancy Analysis

```{r}
#Load tidyverse and gapminder 
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

#Load the gapminder unfiltered dataset: 
data("gapminder_unfiltered")
```

Find the maximum life expectancy for each year and the country which had the maximum life expectancy. 

```{r}
#Use group_by and filter to find the country and corresponding max life expectancy for each year: 
gapminder_unfiltered %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
  select(country, lifeExp) -> sumdat
```
